# Guide: Comprehensive Documentation & AI Navigation Framework

**Version:** 3.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-06
**Status:** Complete Framework - Domain-Driven Documentation + AI Navigation System

This document is the **single source of truth** for creating, maintaining, and navigating documentation within the NoCapLife Coach project. It combines the **Domain-Driven Documentation** approach for feature specifications with the **AI Navigation System** for optimal AI assistant efficiency and human developer experience.

## Overview: Dual-Layer Documentation System

Our documentation framework operates on two complementary layers:

1. **Content Layer**: Domain-driven modular documentation for features and specifications
2. **Navigation Layer**: AI-optimized navigation system for efficient context usage

This dual approach ensures documentation scales effectively from solo development to 1M+ users while maintaining optimal AI assistant performance.

## Part I: AI Navigation System

### Core Navigation Files (Required for All Projects)

#### startHere.md (Master Navigation Hub)
- **Purpose:** Primary entry point when AI loads entire memory bank
- **Location:** `memory-bank/startHere.md`
- **Content Requirements:**
  - File size categorization system (🔴🟡🟢)
  - Task-specific navigation paths
  - Directory structure guide
  - Performance guidelines
- **Maintenance:** Update navigation paths when adding new features or major files

#### executive summary at the top of the file (Large File Optimization)
- **Purpose:** Context-optimized summaries for files >600 lines
- **Location:** at the top of large files
- **Content Requirements:**
  - Section-based navigation using `## Section Name` format
  - Key APIs/interfaces for each large file
  - Integration points and dependencies
  - Quick navigation instructions for AI
- **Maintenance:** Add new summaries when files exceed 600 lines

#### AI_GUIDE.md (AI Assistant Instructions)
- **Purpose:** Detailed AI optimization guide and usage patterns
- **Location:** `memory-bank/AI_GUIDE.md`
- **Content Requirements:**
  - File size guide with context optimization
  - Smart search patterns by task type
  - Context layering strategies
  - Performance tips and success metrics
- **Maintenance:** Update when changing file organization or adding new patterns

### File Size Categorization System

All documentation files must be categorized for AI context optimization:

```
🟢 AI-Friendly Files (<400 lines)
- Use directly in AI context
- Combine multiple related files
- Examples: calculator specs, small guides

🟡 Large Files (400-600 lines)
- Start with executive summary
- Use specific sections by ## headers
- Examples: technical architecture, roadmaps

🔴 Very Large Files (>600 lines)
- ALWAYS start with executive summary
- Section-based navigation required
- Examples: implementation specs, content strategies
```

### Section-Based Navigation Standards

All files >300 lines must use standardized section headers:

```markdown
## Authentication Architecture
## Database Schema
## Component Architecture
## UI Copy & Messaging
## Business Logic Engine
## Integration Patterns
## Primary User Flow
## Error & Edge Cases
```

**Navigation Format:** Search using `## Section Name` (not line numbers)
**Stability:** Section headers are stable; line numbers change frequently

### File Purpose Headers (Required for All Files >200 lines)

```markdown
**Purpose:** What this file accomplishes
**When to use:** Specific scenarios for referencing this file
**Quick sections:** Key ## headers for navigation
**Size:** 🔴/🟡/🟢 indicator
```

## Part II: Domain-Driven Documentation Structure

### Core Problem Statement

Our previous documentation approach resulted in monolithic specification files that became difficult for AI assistants to process accurately and efficiently. Large files led to:
- Incomplete context processing
- Increased errors in updates
- Difficulty in maintaining specific sections
- Poor discoverability of information
- Reduced collaboration efficiency

### Framework Principles (MIMIC + Navigation)

- **Modular:** Features represented by self-contained folders, not single files
- **Manifest-Driven:** Each feature folder contains central README.md navigation hub
- **Concerns-Separated:** Information organized into specialized files by functional domains
- **Section-Navigable:** All files use standardized ## headers for AI navigation
- **Size-Optimized:** File size categories guide AI context usage

### Standard Feature Documentation Structure

Every feature should be documented using this standardized folder structure:

```

## Part III: AI Navigation Workflows

### Task-Specific Navigation Paths

#### Building Features
```
1. startHere.md (navigation)
2. executive summary at the top of the file (if working with 🔴 files)
3. feature-specs/Apps/[similar-calculator].md (reference implementation)
4. guides/ui-component-library-guide.md (UI patterns)
```

#### Database/Infrastructure Work
```
1. executive summary at the top of the file (supabase summary)
2. feature-specs/supabase-setup.md → search "## Database Schema"
3. systemPatterns.md (data patterns)
```

#### Authentication/User Flow
```
1. feature-specs/supabase-setup.md → search "## Authentication Architecture"
2. features/cholesterol-insights/user-experience.md → search "## Primary User Flow"
3. features/cholesterol-insights/implementation.md → search "## API Integration"
```

#### UI/UX Development
```
1. executive summary at the top of the file (UX summary)
2. features/cholesterol-insights/content-strategy.md → search "## UI Copy & Messaging"
3. guides/ui-component-library-guide.md (component patterns)
```

### Context Optimization Rules

#### Efficient AI Usage (✅ Do This)
- Start with startHere.md for full memory bank loads
- Use executive summary at the top of the file first for 🔴 files
- Search by section headers (`## Section Name`)
- Combine related 🟢 files together
- Follow task-specific navigation paths

#### Inefficient AI Usage (❌ Avoid This)
- Loading multiple complete 🔴 files
- Using line numbers instead of section headers
- Mixing unrelated documentation
- Ignoring file size indicators
- Including historical/archive content unnecessarily

## Part IV: Implementation & Maintenance

### For New Features

1. **Create folder structure** using standard template
2. **Start with README.md** for overview and navigation
3. **Develop requirements.md** before implementation begins
4. **Build other files iteratively** as feature develops
5. **Add to executive summary at the top of the file** if any file exceeds 600 lines
6. **Update startHere.md** navigation paths if needed

### For Large File Management

#### When File Exceeds 400 Lines (🟡 Threshold)
1. Add standardized section headers
2. Include file purpose header
3. Consider splitting if file serves multiple concerns

#### When File Exceeds 600 Lines (🔴 Threshold)
1. **Required:** Add summary to executive summary at the top of the file
2. **Required:** Standardized section headers
3. **Required:** File purpose header
4. **Evaluate:** Split into sub-files if serving multiple concerns

#### Sub-file Strategy
Create subfolders when splitting large files:
```
technical-design/
  data-models.md
  business-logic.md
  architecture.md
README.md (updated with navigation to sub-files)
```

### Section Header Standards

Maintain consistency across all documentation:

```markdown
## Authentication Architecture     # For auth-related content
## Database Schema                # For database structure
## Component Architecture         # For React/UI components
## Data Flow & State Management   # For state and data handling
## API Integration               # For backend integration
## Business Logic Engine         # For business rules and algorithms
## UI Copy & Messaging           # For user-facing content
## Primary User Flow             # For main user journey
## Error & Edge Cases            # For error handling
## File Organization             # For project structure
## Integration Patterns          # For system integration
## Performance Considerations    # For optimization
## Testing Strategy              # For test planning
## Security Considerations       # For security measures
```

### Cross-File Linking Strategy

- **Feature-internal links:** `[See UX Flow](./user-experience.md#primary-user-flow)`
- **Cross-feature links:** `[Related Feature](../other-feature/README.md)`
- **Code references:** `[Implementation](../../src/components/FeatureName.tsx)`
- **Navigation references:** `[Navigation Guide](../../startHere.md#building-features)`

### Code Comment Integration

#### Enhanced TSDoc/JSDoc with Navigation
```typescript
/**
