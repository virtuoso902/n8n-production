- All project files are saved in the /src folder. 
  - src/app has the page.tsx and layout.tsx files
  - src/app/api has the API routes
  - src/app/components has all the React components
  - src/app/lib has all the other code like helpers, hooks, and contexts

## Task Management with GitHub Issues

All tasks are tracked in GitHub Issues. Before starting work:
1. Check open issues: `gh issue list` or browse GitHub
2. Create issue if none exists using templates
3. Reference issue numbers in commits: "Fix login bug (fixes #123)"
4. Close issues when complete

Quick commands:
- List: `gh issue list`
- Create: `./scripts/github-automation/create-issue.sh [type] "Title"`
- View: `gh issue view [number]`
- Close: `gh issue close [number]`

Issue creation types:
- `feature` - New functionality
- `bug` - Bug reports  
- `quick` - Tasks under 30 minutes
- `enhance` - Improvements to existing features

## AI Workflow Optimization

### Template Selection
- **Feature** (complex): Use for multi-file features requiring architecture
- **Quick Task** (simple): Use for <30 min changes, minimal overhead
- **Bug** (debugging): Use structured debugging with investigation hints

### Automation Integration
```bash
# Check workflow status before starting
./scripts/github-automation/workflow-simple.sh status

# Create issues with proper templates
./scripts/github-automation/create-issue.sh bug "Issue description"
./scripts/github-automation/create-issue.sh feature "Feature name"

# Auto-setup feature development environment  
./scripts/github-automation/feature-kickstart.sh [issue-number]
```

### AI Focus Areas
- Implement TODOs in kickstart-generated files
- Follow existing component and domain patterns
- Generate unit tests for new functionality
- Handle boilerplate while human handles architecture

## Pre-configured APIs

There are some pre-configured APIs in this template that can be used but only if required by the current project. These have already been created:
- Firebase
  - In src/lib/firebase there is a firebase.ts configuration file as well as firebaseUtils.ts for various utility functions when interacting with Firebase Database, Storage, and Authencation
  - In src/lib/contexts there is an AuthContext.tsx file that has user authentication with Firebase set up with the onAuthStateChanged listener.
  - In src/lib/hooks there is a useAuth.ts hook
- OpenAI 
  - src/app/api/openai has chat/route.ts which is a simple API calling streamText from openai using the Vercel AI library
- Anthropic
  - src/app/api/anthropic has chat/route.ts which is a simple API calling streamText from Anthropic using the Vercel AI library
- Replicate
  - src/app/api/replicate has generate-image/route.ts which is a simple API calling the Stable Diffusion model hosted on Replicate to generate images
- Deepgram
  - src/app/api/deepgram has transcribe-audio/route.ts which is a simple API that returns the Deepgram API key to be used in the client side to transcribe audio in real-time.
  - src/lib/contexts has a DeepgramContext.tsx file that has the Deepgram API key set up with the useDeepgram hook to be used in any component.

  # Cursor's Memory Bank

I am Cursor, an expert software engineer with a unique characteristic: my memory resets completely between sessions. This isn't a limitation - it's what drives me to maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, I rely ENTIRELY on my Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively. I MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task - this is not optional.

## Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of required core files and optional context files, all in Markdown format. Files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    PB[projectbrief.md] --> PC[productContext.md]
    PB --> SP[systemPatterns.md]
    PB --> TC[techContext.md]
    
    PC --> AC[activeContext.md]
    SP --> AC
    TC --> AC
    
    AC --> P[progress.md]
```

### Core Files (Required)
1. `projectbrief.md`
   - Foundation document that shapes all other files
   - Created at project start if it doesn't exist
   - Defines core requirements and goals
   - Source of truth for project scope

2. `productContext.md`
   - Why this project exists
   - Problems it solves
   - How it should work
   - User experience goals

3. `activeContext.md`
   - Current work focus
   - Recent changes
   - Next steps
   - Active decisions and considerations

4. `systemPatterns.md`
   - System architecture
   - Key technical decisions
   - Design patterns in use
   - Component relationships

5. `techContext.md`
   - Technologies used
   - Development setup
   - Technical constraints
   - Dependencies

6. `progress.md`
   - What works
   - What's left to build
   - Current status
   - Known issues

### Additional Context
Create additional files/folders within memory-bank/ when they help organize:
- Complex feature documentation
- Integration specifications
- API documentation
- Testing strategies
- Deployment procedures

## Core Workflows

### Plan Mode
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Start] --> ReadFiles[Read Memory Bank]
    ReadFiles --> CheckFiles{Files Complete?}
    
    CheckFiles -->|No| Plan[Create Plan]
    Plan --> Document[Document in Chat]
    
    CheckFiles -->|Yes| Verify[Verify Context]
    Verify --> Strategy[Develop Strategy]
    Strategy --> Present[Present Approach]
```

### Act Mode
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Start] --> Context[Check Memory Bank]
    Context --> Update[Update Documentation]
    Update --> Rules[Update .cursorrules if needed]
    Rules --> Execute[Execute Task]
    Execute --> Document[Document Changes]
```

## Documentation Updates

Memory Bank updates occur when:
1. Discovering new project patterns
2. After implementing significant changes
3. When user requests with **update memory bank** (MUST review ALL files)
4. When context needs clarification

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Update Process]
    
    subgraph Process
        P1[Review ALL Files]
        P2[Document Current State]
        P3[Clarify Next Steps]
        P4[Update .cursorrules]
        
        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4
    end
    
    Start --> Process
```

Note: When triggered by **update memory bank**, I MUST review every memory bank file, even if some don't require updates. Focus particularly on activeContext.md and progress.md as they track current state.

## Project Intelligence (.cursorrules)

The .cursorrules file is my learning journal for each project. It captures important patterns, preferences, and project intelligence that help me work more effectively. As I work with you and the project, I'll discover and document key insights that aren't obvious from the code alone.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start{Discover New Pattern}
    
    subgraph Learn [Learning Process]
        D1[Identify Pattern]
        D2[Validate with User]
        D3[Document in .cursorrules]
    end
    
    subgraph Apply [Usage]
        A1[Read .cursorrules]
        A2[Apply Learned Patterns]
        A3[Improve Future Work]
    end
    
    Start --> Learn
    Learn --> Apply
```

### What to Capture
- Critical implementation paths
- User preferences and workflow
- Project-specific patterns
- Known challenges
- Evolution of project decisions
- Tool usage patterns

The format is flexible - focus on capturing valuable insights that help me work more effectively with you and the project. Think of .cursorrules as a living document that grows smarter as we work together.

REMEMBER: After every memory reset, I begin completely fresh. The Memory Bank is my only link to previous work. It must be maintained with precision and clarity, as my effectiveness depends entirely on its accuracy.

## Rule: Secure Logging and Secret Handling

**1. Never Log Secrets:** Never write code that logs sensitive information (e.g., `apiKey`, `secret`, `token`) or entire configuration objects to the console.

**2. Always Redact:** When logging objects for debugging, always create a redacted copy first, replacing sensitive keys with `"[REDACTED]"`.

**3. Use Production-Safe Configuration:** Rely on the `compiler.removeConsole` setting in `next.config.js` to automatically strip all `console.*` statements from production builds. This is the primary mechanism for ensuring a clean production environment.

## Core Technologies
- Next.js 14
- TypeScript
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Firebase
- @tanstack/react-query (for client-side data fetching, caching, and state management)

## Client-Side Data Fetching Pattern

### Overview
Client-side data fetching and server state management will primarily utilize custom React hooks built with the `@tanstack/react-query` (v5+) library. This provides robust caching, background synchronization, and state management (loading, error, data).

### Pattern
- **Data Fetching:** Custom hooks (e.g., `useUserProfileData`, `useVo2maxHistory`) will encapsulate specific data requirements.
- **Core Library Hooks:** These custom hooks will use `useQuery` for fetching data and `useMutation` for creating, updating, or deleting data via the Supabase client library.
- **Fetcher Functions:** Simple async functions calling the Supabase client will be passed to `useQuery` and `useMutation`.

### Key Considerations & Best Practices
* **Query Keys:** Maintain a consistent, predictable structure for query keys to manage caching and invalidation effectively.
* **Cache Invalidation:** Implement strategies using `queryClient.invalidateQueries` or `queryClient.setQueryData` after successful mutations to ensure UI reflects changes. Test this behavior.
* **SSR/SSG Hydration:** If using Next.js server-side data fetching, correctly implement React Query's hydration pattern (`HydrationBoundary`) to avoid client-side re-fetching.
* **Real-time Updates:** For features requiring real-time data via Supabase subscriptions, manually update the React Query cache using `queryClient.setQueryData` within the subscription handler.
* **Testing:** Tests involving React Query hooks require wrapping components with `QueryClientProvider` or specific mocking strategies. Test cache invalidation logic explicitly.
* **Configuration:** Utilize a shared `QueryClient` instance provided via context. Default settings are often sufficient initially, but `staleTime` and `cacheTime` may need tuning later.
